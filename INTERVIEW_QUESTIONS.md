# Big Tech Interview Questions for AI-Powered Personal Finance Tracker

## 1. Technical Deep Dive Questions

### Frontend & React Questions

**Q: Explain the component architecture of your finance tracker. How did you structure your React components?**

**A:** I structured the application using a modular component architecture:
- **Layout Components**: Header with navigation and user controls
- **Page Components**: Dashboard, AuthPage for different views
- **Feature Components**: TransactionForm, TransactionList, StatsCards, ExpenseChart, AIPredictions
- **UI Components**: Reusable Button, Card, Input, Modal components
- **Context Providers**: AuthContext for authentication state, ThemeContext for dark/light mode

I followed the Single Responsibility Principle, keeping each component focused on one specific functionality. The components are organized in a hierarchical structure with clear data flow using props and context.

**Q: How did you implement state management in your application?**

**A:** I used a combination of approaches:
- **React Context API**: For global state like authentication (AuthContext) and theme (ThemeContext)
- **Custom Hooks**: useTransactions hook for transaction-related state and operations
- **Local State**: useState for component-specific state like form inputs and UI states
- **Server State**: Supabase handles the persistence layer with real-time updates

This approach avoids the complexity of Redux while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

**Q: Explain your authentication implementation. How do you handle security?**

**A:** I implemented authentication using Supabase Auth:
- **Email/Password Authentication**: Secure signup and login
- **JWT Tokens**: Automatic token management by Supabase
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level security ensuring users only access their data
- **Protected Routes**: AuthContext provides user state to protect dashboard routes
- **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and logout handling

Security measures include:
- Input validation on both client and server
- SQL injection prevention through Supabase's prepared statements
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure token storage

### Backend & Database Questions

**Q: Why did you choose Supabase over other backend solutions?**

**A:** I chose Supabase for several reasons:
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust, ACID-compliant database with excellent performance
- **Real-time capabilities**: Automatic real-time updates for collaborative features
- **Built-in Authentication**: Reduces development time and security risks
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level security policies
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety from database to frontend
- **Scalability**: Handles growth from prototype to production
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and documentation

**Q: Explain your database schema design. How did you optimize for performance?**

**A:** Database schema:
```sql
transactions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  amount numeric NOT NULL,
  category text NOT NULL,
  description text,
  date date NOT NULL,
  type text CHECK (type IN ('income', 'expense')),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
)
```

Optimizations:
- **Indexes**: Created indexes on user_id, date, and type for fast queries
- **Data Types**: Used appropriate types (numeric for money, date for dates)
- **Constraints**: Check constraints for data integrity
- **Foreign Keys**: Proper relationships with cascade deletes
- **RLS Policies**: Efficient row-level security without application-level filtering

**Q: How do you handle data consistency and transactions?**

**A:** 
- **ACID Properties**: PostgreSQL ensures atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Maintain referential integrity
- **Check Constraints**: Ensure data validity (positive amounts, valid types)
- **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, rollback on error
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- **Data Validation**: Both client-side and server-side validation

### AI/ML Questions

**Q: Explain your AI prediction algorithm. How does it work?**

**A:** My AI system uses several techniques:

1. **Linear Regression**: Analyzes spending trends over time using least squares method
2. **Moving Averages**: Smooths data to reduce noise and identify patterns
3. **Trend Analysis**: Calculates slope to determine increasing/decreasing/stable trends
4. **Weighted Prediction**: Recent months get higher weights (30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%)
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Based on data consistency using coefficient of variation

```typescript
// Simplified algorithm
const prediction = recentMonths.reduce((sum, amount, index) => {
  const weight = weights[index];
  return sum + (amount * weight);
}, 0);

// Adjust for trend
if (trend === 'increasing') prediction *= 1.1;
if (trend === 'decreasing') prediction *= 0.9;
```

**Q: How would you improve the AI predictions with more data?**

**A:** With more data, I would implement:
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Identify yearly patterns (holidays, tax season)
- **External Factors**: Incorporate economic indicators, weather data
- **Machine Learning Models**: LSTM networks for time series prediction
- **Feature Engineering**: Day of week, month, holiday indicators
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better accuracy
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify and handle outliers
- **Personalization**: User-specific spending patterns and preferences

**Q: How do you measure the accuracy of your predictions?**

**A:** I would implement several metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average prediction error
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Percentage-based accuracy
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Penalizes larger errors more
- **Confidence Intervals**: Provide prediction ranges
